# AI Travel Agent üåç‚úàÔ∏è

A comprehensive, AI-powered travel agent that helps you plan every aspect of your trip. Just provide your destination, duration, and interests, and the agent will generate a detailed itinerary, including attractions, restaurants, weather forecasts, budget breakdowns, and more.

## Features

- **Dynamic Itinerary Generation:** Creates detailed day-by-day plans based on your interests.
- **Real-time Information:** Fetches current weather and multi-day forecasts.
- **Comprehensive Search:** Finds top attractions, restaurants, activities, and transportation options.
- **Accommodation Suggestions:** Recommends hotels based on your budget (budget, mid-range, luxury).
- **Budgeting Tools:** Calculates hotel costs, daily budgets, and total trip costs.
- **Currency Conversion:** Provides real-time exchange rates and currency conversions.
- **PDF Export:** Saves your complete travel plan as a downloadable PDF.

## How It Works

This application is built with a sophisticated agentic architecture using the following technologies:

- **LangChain & LangGraph:** The core framework for building the AI agent and defining the workflow. The agent uses a set of tools to gather information and construct the travel plan.
- **Groq:** Powers the language model (LLaMA3) for fast and intelligent responses.
- **Tavily Search:** The primary search engine for finding information about attractions, hotels, and more.
- **OpenWeatherMap:** Provides real-time weather data.
- **Streamlit:** Creates the interactive web user interface.

The agent takes a user's query, breaks it down into steps, and uses the available tools to find the necessary information. The entire process, including the agent's "thoughts," is streamed to the user interface, providing transparency into how the plan is being created.
